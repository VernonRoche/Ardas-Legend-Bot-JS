# Ardas-Legend-Bot-JS
A revamp of the AL bot, developed in order to automate different tasks, using Discord's Javascript library.

Utilizing Node.js, the aim of the whole software is to remove the manual tasks from the Arda's Legend server staff, and move the management of movements, roleplay applications, entity creations and much more into a unified suite.
